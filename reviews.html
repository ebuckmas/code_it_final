            <p>Evan is fantastic and without his help - we would have sold our home for less than our closing amount.  He was right on target with comparables and featured our home in the newspaper and online with beautiful photo's that he took. Evan went so far as to scoop our driveway for a showing when we were out of town! Very professional!</p>

            <p>Evan helped with the purchase and sale of my home in Bloomington. He went above and beyond helping with the purchase by visiting the property and taking video of a walkthrough when I couldn't be there because I was out of the state. He pulled several comps and help to negotiate the repairs in a seller's market. During the sales process he kept me up-to-date on competitive properties that were coming to market and help to facilitate repairs and prep work needed to get the house ready for sale. I highly recommend him as a realtor and wouldn't hesitate to use his services again in the future.</p>

            <p>Evan was incredible. Right on top of anything that needed to be done. He helped connect us with top quality repair people for fixing up our house to sell.

            <p>We recently bought a house from across the country with Evan. He lined everything up, handled all communication with the seller, and walked us through the entire process. He was in constant contact 7 days a week when necessary. Additionally, Evan was very patient and supportive when we decided to withdraw an offer after finding a house we liked more. Evan really made a nerve racking prices much easier for us.</p>

            <p>I highly recommend Evan as your realtor. We have had a few different realtors in the past and nothing compared to how Evan worked for us. He cared more about ensuring we got what we needed and were looking for vs making the sale. He went out of his way to look for our best interest and couldn't be happier with the property.</p>

Evan worked extremely hard to make the home-buying process was as simple as it could be, and indeed, we were surprised at how smooth of a process everything was at the end.

            <p>I highly recommend Evan not only because he is a great person to work with, but he cares about our needs and finds a perfect home for us. I learned about Evan from my colleague. Like many other first time home buyers, I was nervous and didn't have much knowledge about the whole process. Evan has been very patient with us and made the whole process very smooth. We met at the first house showing and started to talk about our needs. Because Evan grew up locally, he has great knowledge about this area. He has provided many good thoughts and suggested great people for us to work together. Evan has done his best to work with our schedules; it was at the midnight when we got our offer accepted. Evan is very honest; he gave us the true idea of purchasing the house whether we could ask for reducing price or we would need to increase our budget. What we appreciate him the most is that he really puts himself at our situation (not his or others) and of course found us the house that we love to call it home. Again, I would love to recommend Evan to all my colleagues or anyone if you are looking for a professional, thoughtful, honest, and respectable person to work with.</p>

            <p>Evan was patient with me for over a year as I thought through what to do about buying a single family house or a condo. He was excellent all around. A few things: (1) Once he realized I stayed current on offerings, he gave me access to his office's customer system so I could see more timely that properties were still available. (2) When I had questions or concerns about something I was seeing, he always had answers or suggestions or important perspectives. (3) Communication was excellent, and if I suggested a property to see, he was on it right away. (4) When a few issues popped up during the inspection, Evan was in touch with contractors within an hour, arranged to meet with them the same day for estimates, and helped me understand the best way to respond back to the seller. It worked out brilliantly. Thanks, Evan!</p>

            <p>Evan listened to me and had a good feel for what I was looking for. On a few occasions, I was the very first person to view a home because he informed me about new listings I might be interested in as soon as he knew about them. Evan also provided excellent tips on things I wouldn't have even known to ask. The whole process of finding and buying a home was made easy because he took care of all the phone calls, appointments, and paperwork. Highly recommend!</p>

            <p>Evan was fantastic when my wife and I thought we were making a move to Bloomington, IN. While we ended up staying put due to job opportunities, if we ever decide to look at the Bloomington area again we know who our realtor will be! Thanks Evan!</p>

            <p>My wife and I used Evan to list our previous home, and it went better than we could have expected!  The listing was extremely professional and appealing, which brought a buyer in less than 3 weeks.  He then helped us look for our next home.  Throughout the process, we found him to be very knowledgeable, always able to offer guidance and answer questions, and most importantly, he was always responsive and available.  He was more than willing to look at every house that interested us (including foreclosures and FSBOs) and ultimately, we were able to purchase a property we love.  We are extremely pleased and recommend him highly.</p>

            <p>My husband I would highly recommend Evan Buckmaster to be your realtor for a variety of reasons.  Evan's follow-up was superb, very knowledgeable about what all was available in Bloomington/Monroe County and selling prices for other properties in the area.  Evan was born and raised in Bloomington, so he has a vast knowledge of the area!  When we asked a question, we would always get a very thorough reply with evidence to back up what he was communicating.  He would take the initiative to check with the HOA, the seller or contracted companies on issues we were in question about without us asking.  Our process was pretty seamless and it was all because of Evan!</p>

            <p>Last January, I hired Mr. Evan to sell my home in a timely fashion, because of my dire situation being laid off from work, and compounded with illness in my family. Lo and behold, within a month,  he was able to find a buyer for the house with a price that was acceptable to me. Before that, he points out certain things need to be modified in the house in order to sell it for a higher price, and I went along with that. To make long story short, It made me happy and the prospective buyer much happier, further more, he went beyoud a call of duty to find me a temporary place to live. I found Mr. Evan extremely professional beyond his age, even though he looks very young . But what impressed me the most about him; He is a man of integrity with moral value. He will work tirelessly to sell your home without compromising his ethics,honesty, and core value.</p>

            <p>My wife and I bought a vacation property a little over two years ago and Evan did a great job in the negotiation and purchase of the property. We did a complete renovation of the place...new HVAC, plumbing, windows, flooring, rebuilding of all 3 decks, kitchen, etc. Two years later, we made the decision to sell the property since it wasn't being used as often as we thought it would. As he did with the original purchase, Evan handled the selling of our property with the same hard work and professionalism. Given the money we invested in our renovation, our goal was to not only sell the property, but to sell it and make a profit. After prepping the property so that it could be listed, Evan took over 2 dozen great photos of the place that really highlighted all of the improvements. He also included a short video that really showed why this property was a great value. Additionally, the photos Evan took of our place really helped to increase the visibility and overall interest of our place. We had an incredible amount of interest in our propertyfrom day one. With Evan's help, we were able to sell our property in just six weeks...for exactly what we were asking for. Thanks Evan</p>

            <p>When we met for the first time,  Expectations were set regarding how I wanted my fully furnished condo to be marketed.  Evan listened and understood who the potential buyer should be.  He was very involved and active showing the property and especially giving me feedback from each showing.  As a seller,  this was a very important part of the seller/buyer relationship.  I couldn't be happier with the results.  The right buyers and the right price for the condo. Thank you Evan!</p>

            <p>Evan just helped me to buy a rental property. He is very professional not only in the process to buy but also provided many useful suggestions for me to rent out the property.  I was well informed during the buying process and feel very easy in the negotiations. I will be recommending Evan Buckmaster to any of my friends.</p>
